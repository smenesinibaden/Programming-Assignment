# ProgrammingAssignment1

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **variables**
2.  Familiarize students with the **printf** and **scanf** functions.
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. Your assignment will be auto-graded and any changes in formatting will result in a loss in the grade.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
3.	**Filename**: Save your program as ```order.c```

## Program
Welcome to McKeith’s! May I take your order?  

We’re going to build a program for a fast food chain to take orders for four people at a time.   

**The program should behave as follows:**  
We’ll be getting the customer’s combo choice in the form of a single digit number between 1 and 9. We’ll also be getting the size of the combo, which should be one of the following characters: S M or L (for Small, Medium, or Large). Then we’ll get the price of the combo, in dollars and cents. We’ll do that for all four customers.  

The program should then display the order back to the user! It should display each of the items in a table that the program creates. Please run the provided executable for an example of the table’s format. Use the formatting techniques learned for conversion specifiers and formatted IO. **Your program’s table should be exactly the same as the table in the provided program.**

### Input:
The user should be prompted for a set of three values which represent the combo number, its size, and its price for the first order. The combo should be a whole number. The size should be a single character. The price should be a decimal number. The user should enter all three values on one line, separated by spaces. The user should then be prompted for the remaining three orders.  

Example (the highlighted part is what the program displays and the italicized part is the user input):  
```Order 1 (combo# size price): ``` *4 M 4.32*

### The example executable:
An example executable is provided in this repository. You should be able to run it from your project folder.
If you encounter a “permission denied” error when attempting to run the executable, type ```chmod u+x orderExecutable``` into the terminal and try running the executable again.
### Hints:
- The vertical line is called a pipe. It's on your keyboard, if you use the Shift + \ key (above the Enter key).
- The double lines are equals (=) and the single lines are dashes (-).
- Make sure you try out different test cases!
- Play close attention to using scanf with variables.
- Make sure you control the formatting of any floating-point output. 

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
